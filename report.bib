  Abstract                 = {One of the purposes of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is to coordinate the activities of its 188 Members in the generation of data and information on weather, climate and water, according to internationally agreed standards. With this in mind, each session of the World Meteorological Congress adopts Technical Regulations which lay down the meteorological practices and procedures to be followed by WMO Members. These Technical Regulations are supplemented by a number of Manuals and Guides which describe in more detail the practices, procedures and specifi cations that Members are requested to follow and implement. While Manuals contain mandatory practices, Guides such as this one contain recommended practices. The first edition of the Guide to Meteorological Instruments and Methods of Observation was published in 1954 and consisted of twelve chapters. Since then, standardization has remained a key concern of the Commission for Instruments and Methods of Observation (CIMO) activities, and CIMO has periodically reviewed the contents of the Guide, making recommendations for additions and amendments whenever appropriate. The present, seventh, edition is a fully revised version which includes additional topics and chapters refl ecting recent technological developments. Its purpose, as with the previous editions, is to give comprehensive and up-to-date guidance on the most effective practices for carrying out meteorological observations and measurements. This edition was prepared through the collaborative efforts of 42 experts from 17 countries and was adopted by the fourteenth session of CIMO (Geneva, December 2006). The Guide describes most instruments, systems and techniques in regular use, from the simplest to the most complex and sophisticated, but does not attempt to deal with methods and instruments used only for research or experimentally. Furthermore, the Guide is not intended to be a detailed instruction manual for use by observers and technicians, but rather, it is intended to provide the basis for the preparation of manuals by National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) or other interested users operating observing systems, to meet their specifi c needs. However, no attempt is made to specify the fully detailed design of instruments, since to do so might hinder their further development. It was instead considered preferable to restrict standardization to the essential requirements and to confi ne recommendations to those features which are generally most common to various confi gurations of a given instrument or measurement system. Although the Guide is written primarily for NMHSs, many other organizations and research and educational institutions taking meteorological observations have found it useful, so their requirements have been kept in mind in the preparation of the Guide. Additionally, many instrument manufacturers have recognized the usefulness of the Guide in the development and production of instruments and systems especially suited to Members’ needs. Because of the considerable demand for this publication, a decision was taken to make it available on the WMO website to all interested users. Therefore, on behalf of WMO, I wish to express my gratitude to all those NMHSs, technical commissions, expert teams and individuals who have contributed to this publication.},

  Abstract                 = {This part of IEC 61400 specifies essential design requirements to ensure the engineering integrity of wind turbines. Its purpose is to provide an appropriate level of protection against damage from all hazards during the planned lifetime. This standard is concerned with all subsystems of wind turbines such as control and protection mechanisms, internal electrical systems, mechanical systems and support structures. This standard applies to wind turbines of all sizes. For small wind turbines IEC 61400-2 may be applied. This standard should be used together with the appropriate IEC and ISO standards mentioned in Clause 2.},

  Abstract                 = {Strong magnetic fields allow levitation of apparently nonmagnetic substances due to their weak but not negligible diamagnetic response of about 10-5. Importantly, the diamagnetic force compensates gravity on the level of individual atoms and molecules and, therefore, can be used to mimic a continuous zero-gravity environment that, otherwise, is only achievable on board of a space station. Here we employ this earth-bound low gravity to demonstrate a simple mechanical gyroscope with sensitivity already comparable to that achieved by quantum and military gyroscopes. Our gyroscope can serve as a `shooting range' for the development of precision orbiting gyroscopes that have been a subject of intensive discussions regarding possible tests of general relativity.},
