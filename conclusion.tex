\chapter{Recommended proceedings}
\label{ch:recproc}
From the final topics given in \Cref{ch:findef}, the topic that fits best within the current plans of \ac{JPL} and the wishes of the TU Delft supervisors will have to be selected, given that personal preference is also very important. In order to be able to proceed from these final topics, a time table guide has been created showing what has to be done and when it is planned to be done:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Settling and choosing a final thesis topic} (21$^{st}$ of September till 30$^{th}$ of September 2015)
\item \textbf{Detailed literature study on the chosen topic together with the subject Research Methodologies} (1$^{st}$ of October till the 30$^{th}$ of November 2015)
\item \textbf{Final thesis proposal} (1$^{st}$ of December till the 7$^{th}$ of December 2015)
\item \textbf{Thesis work} (8$^{th}$ of December 2015 till the 1$^{st}$ of August 2016  including holidays)
\end{itemize}

These proceedings are based on the required 2 month literature study and 7 month thesis. The thesis study officially begins from the moment that the thesis proposal is approved.
