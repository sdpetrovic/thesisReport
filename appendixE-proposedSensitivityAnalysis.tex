\label{app:appendixE-proposedSensitivityAnalysis}

The purpose of the sensitivity analysis is to determine the effects of the different parameters on the performance and the outcome of the program. The different test cases to determine these effects are described in \Cref{tab:testCases1,tab:testCases2}. The parameter cases that I give the most priority to are mentioned in \Cref{tab:testCases1} and then in decreasing order of priority in \Cref{tab:testCases2}. The accuracy will always be compared to the nominal case. The differences are compared to the different cases per parameter. All cases are also computed for \ac{RKF} and compared to the \ac{TSI} results. For comparison purposes, a similar integration cut-off requirement is used for the different test cases (might vary per parameter though).
